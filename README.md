# PyMOL made easier with horizontal scripting
*Script to facilitate the making of horizontal scripts*

Welcome to the `EasyPyMOL` repository, which implements the PyMOL approaches described in the manuscript:
[Blaine Mooers](http://www.oumedicine.com/department-of-biochemistry-and-molecular-biology/faculty/blaine-mooers-ph-d-) (*submitted*).
Easier use of PyMOL with horizontal scripts. [*PLOS ONE*](http://www.plosone.org/).

## *Problem*: viewing port matrix from [`get_view()`](http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Get_View) in [PyMOL](https://www.pymol.org/) is too hard to copy and paste quickly onto one line with other commands during horizontal scripting

```python
PyMOL>get_view  

### cut below here and paste into script ###  
set_view(\
  -0.832868993,    0.398498207,    0.383896619,\
  -0.260102808,   -0.894237876,    0.363985002,\
   0.488390923,    0.203309149,    0.848513067,\
   0.000000000,    0.000000000,  -61.396984100,\
 -46.246913910,   -4.663769245,   42.401920319,\
  56.260883331,   66.533096313,  -20.000000000 )
### cut above here and paste into script ###
```

## *Solution*: The function `roundview()` in [`roundview.py`](.\roundview.py)

```py
PyMOL>roundview  
set_view(-0.83,0.4,0.38,-0.26,-0.89,0.36,0.49,0.2,0.85,0.0,0.0,-61.4,-46.25,-4.66,42.4,56.26,66.53,-20.0);
```
    
Paste above reformated [`set_view()`](http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Set_View) command onto the PyMOL [command line](http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Command_Line_Options) in the external gui or into a [script](http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/Running_Scripts).

What this is
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This python script includes the short function `roundview()` to reformat the viewing port setting matrix from six rows to one row for use with other commands separated by a command line on a single row.  

Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requires a molecular object loaded into an interactive session of PyMOL. Does not
require any external modules. Tested on:
* Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit with PyMOL 1.7.2.2. 
* Windows 8 32 bit  running PyMOL 1.7.6.2 and PyMOL 1.7.6.6. 
* Mac OSX 10.10.5 64 bit running PyMOL 1.5.0.5 and 1.7.6.6. 

Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### How to install

Get the script. Either download the folder from [this link](https://github.com/MooersLab/PymoMooersLab/archive/master.zip) or type in a terminal window in your home directory or the directory where you store your PyMOL python scripts 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/MooersLab/EasyPyMOL.git
```

You need the program [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer. Git is available via macports on a mac or otherwise [see these instructions for installing git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).


There are at least four ways of loading the script into PyMOL:

1. move [`roundview.py`](./roundview.py) to the working directory of pymol. In pymol, type 

    ```py
    run roundview.py
    ```

2. load [`roundview.py`](./roundview.py) with the plugin manager (see plugin pulldown) in PyMOL

3. copy [`roundview.py`](./roundview.py) to the following hidden folder `~.pymol/startup` in your home directory or to the startup folder inside your MacPyMOL.app.

4. create or edit the hidden file `.pymolrc` text file in the home directory so that it includes the following lines so that roundview.py is always loaded upon startup:

    ```py
    import sys
    sys.path.append('/Path/To/roundview')
    run /Path/To/roundview.py
    ```

##### How to run

After loading a pdb file and setting up the molecular scene, type on one of the command lines in PyMOL:

```py
PyMOL>roundview
```

##### How to get help

Type the following on ona of the command lines in PyMOL

```py
PyMOL> help roundview
```

Usage: `roundview [view, significant digits, outname]` 
* The values in the [ ] are optional.  
* The default view is "0". 
* The default number of `significant digits` is 2. 
* The `outname` is the name of a plain text file to which the output of `roundveiw()` is written.

Quick test with wildtype bacteriophage T4 lysozyme, 3fa0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open up pymol. Copy and paste the entire line below onto the command line in the external gui (the on above the GL viewing port). This is an example of a horizontal script. By hitting the up arrow key, you can recall this command for editing on the command line. This code block is  more agile to edit than opening, editing, saving, and loading an external script file.

```py
fetch 3fa0,async=0;orient;turn z,-90;turn y,-5;turn x,10; hide everything; bg_color white; show cartoon;color red, ss h;color yellow, ss s;color green, ss l+'';roundview  
```
  
To apply the canonical view similar to that in [Gassner et al. 2003](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12646375), copy and paste the following onto the command line:
  
```py
set_view (-0.18,-0.69,-0.7,0.98,-0.17,-0.09,-0.06,-0.7,0.71,0.0,0.0,-154.87,34.77,11.27,9.52,121.27,188.47,-20.0); ray 1500,1600; png coanonical.png
```
  	
You should get back an image that looks like the following:

To test some other argument values, copy paste the following command. 

```py
PyMOL>roundview 0,1,firstscene.txt
```

Do a `ls *.txt` to list the files in the working diretory. The file "firstscene.txt" should be listed. The default filename is "roundedview.txt". These file is appended with each execution of the roundview command.
